# claude-recall-cli

Save and search reusable Claude Code session entries. Global slash commands backed by SQLite + FTS5.

## Install

**One-liner (clone + install):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nino-chavez/claude-recall-cli.git ~/.claude/recall-cli && bash ~/.claude/recall-cli/install.sh
```

**Or via curl:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nino-chavez/claude-recall-cli/main/install.sh | bash
```

This installs `/recall` and `/recall-scan` as global Claude Code slash commands available in every session.

## Usage

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/recall save` | Extract an entry from the current session |
| `/recall find <query>` | Search saved entries by keyword |
| `/recall list` | Show recent entries |
| `/recall show <id>` | Show full entry details |
| `/recall use <id>` | Get the prompt template ready to use |
| `/recall use <id> --var key=value` | Fill in template variables |
| `/recall stats` | Library statistics |
| `/recall analyze` | Analyze a session for quality patterns |
| `/recall quality` | Quality trends across recent sessions |
| `/recall quality --days 7` | Quality trends for last N days |
| `/recall verify <id>` | Rate a session outcome (pass/fail, satisfaction, followup) |
| `/recall backfill` | Backfill analysis metrics on older entries |
| `/recall-scan` | Scan recent sessions for recall-worthy patterns |
| `/recall-scan 7` | Scan last N days |
| `/recall-scan all` | Scan all sessions |

## Automatic scanning (session-end hook)

By default, scanning is manual. To automatically scan for recall-worthy sessions every time a Claude Code session ends, add a `SessionEnd` hook to your global settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionEnd": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ~/.claude/commands/recall-scan.py --days 1 --min-score 30 --limit 5 >> ~/.claude/recall-scan.log 2>&1",
            "timeout": 30
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This logs candidates to `~/.claude/recall-scan.log` after each session. Review the log periodically and `/recall save` the sessions worth keeping.

You can adjust `--min-score` (0-100, default 30) and `--days` to tune sensitivity.

## How it works

- Entries are stored in `~/.claude/recall.db` (SQLite with FTS5 full-text search)
- `/recall save` analyzes the current session transcript and extracts intent, tools used, outcome, and a reusable prompt template with `{{variable}}` placeholders
- `/recall-scan` scores past sessions by efficiency, output, focus, and intent clarity to find sessions worth saving
- No dependencies beyond Python 3 stdlib + SQLite

## Quality analysis

`/recall analyze` and `/recall quality` assess sessions across two independent layers:

### Compliance — graded (A-F)

**Did Claude follow its own documented system prompt rules?** These checks have ground truth — documented instructions with right/wrong answers.

- **Tool selection** — Bash calls that should have used Read/Edit/Grep/Glob (rules extracted from Claude Code's system prompt)
- **Anti-patterns** — Retry loops, exploration dead-ends, edits without prior reads, excessive sub-agents

Rules sourced from [Claude Code system prompts](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/claude-code-system-prompts) via `baseline.json`. Update when Claude Code releases new tool guidance.

### Process metrics — descriptive only, NOT graded

**How did the session behave?** These metrics describe session shape, not quality. Task complexity, model choice, and session intent all affect them legitimately. A research-heavy Opus session is not "worse" than a quick Haiku fix.

- **Planning** — File thrash ratio (same file edited repeatedly)
- **Session shape** — Classified as `direct_execution`, `brief_alignment`, `research_then_build`, `extended_discussion`, `late_start`, or `exploration_only`
- **Cost efficiency** — Tokens per productive tool call (heavily model-dependent)

Thresholds in `thresholds.json` are user-tunable.

### Outcome tracking (manual, for future correlation)

The database schema includes `outcome_verified` and `had_followup_fix` columns. Set these manually on saved entries to build a dataset correlating process metrics with actual outcomes. This is the path to real quality measurement.

### Versioning

Every output includes `heuristic_version` (currently v3). Bump `HEURISTIC_VERSION` in `recall-cli.py` when you change scoring rules. Scores from different versions should not be compared.

### What this is NOT

This analysis is **not derived from or comparative to any Anthropic internal evaluation framework**. Compliance checks whether Claude followed its published rules. Process metrics are descriptive telemetry. Neither claims to measure the quality of the code produced or the user's satisfaction with the session.

## Update

```bash
git -C ~/.claude/recall-cli pull
```

Symlinks mean updates take effect immediately.

## Uninstall

```bash
rm ~/.claude/commands/recall.md ~/.claude/commands/recall-cli.py
rm ~/.claude/commands/recall-scan.md ~/.claude/commands/recall-scan.py
rm -rf ~/.claude/recall-cli
# Optionally remove the database: rm ~/.claude/recall.db
```
